object TraitFactoryPattern extends App {


  // Factory pattern: The Factory Method defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate.

  // Step 1: Define a wrapper object called Cakes to hold various types of cakes
  object Cakes {

    // Step 2: Define a base trait to represent a Cake
    trait Cake {
      def name: String
    }

    // With the Cake trait defined, we can extend it to create various types of cakes.
    // Step 3: Define class implementations for the Cake trait namely: Cupcake, Donut and UnknownCake
    class UnknownCake extends Cake {
      override def name: String = "Unknown Cake ... but still delicious!"
    }

    class Cupcake extends Cake {
      override def name: String = "Cupcake"
    }

    class Donut extends Cake {
      override def name: String = "Donut"
    }

  }



  // Step 4: Define another object with an apply() method as factory for types of cakes
  object CakeFactory {
    import Cakes._

    // Step 5: Define an apply method which will act as a factory to produce the correct Cake implementation
    def apply(cake: String): Cake = {
      cake match {
        case "cupcake" => new Cupcake
        case "donut" => new Donut
        case _ => new UnknownCake
      }
    }
  }


  // Step 6: Call the CakeFactory
  println(s"A cupcake = ${CakeFactory("cupcake").name}")
  println(s"A donut = ${CakeFactory("donut").name}")
  println(s"Unknown cake = ${CakeFactory("coconut tart").name}")
}
